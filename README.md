# Global-health-life-expectancy-
Exploratory Data Analysis on Global Health and Life Expectancy (2000–2015

# 🌍 Global Health and Life Expectancy Analysis  
This project explores global health trends and life expectancy data between 2000 and 2015.  
Using data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA), it identifies key factors influencing life expectancy across developed and developing nations.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
The analysis focuses on understanding:
- How economic, social, and health indicators affect life expectancy.
- Differences between developed and developing countries.
- The impact of GDP, schooling, BMI, and vaccination rates on global longevity.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values using mean/median/mode.
- Renamed inconsistent column names for clarity.
- Derived new columns for deeper insights.
- Detected and removed outliers using the IQR method.

---

## 📊 Data Visualization & Analysis
- **Distribution Analysis:** KDE plots for variables like Alcohol, and GDP.  
- **Comparative Analysis:** Bar charts comparing vaccination rates (Developed vs Developing).  
- **Correlation Analysis:** Heatmap to identify relationships among variables.  
- **Trend Analysis:** Line plots showing life expectancy changes over years.  
- **Scatter Analysis:** Exploring GDP, Schooling, and BMI vs Life Expectancy.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Life expectancy has increased globally but disparities remain.
- Developed countries have higher life expectancy and vaccination coverage.
- GDP, education, and healthcare access strongly influence longevity.
- Reducing adult mortality and improving immunization programs are crucial for developing nations.
- Continuous investment in education, healthcare, and vaccination is essential to improve global longevity.

---

## 🧩 Conclusion
Economic growth, education, and healthcare improvements are major drivers of longer, healthier lives.  
Although progress is global, developing nations still need stronger public health initiatives to close the life expectancy gap.
